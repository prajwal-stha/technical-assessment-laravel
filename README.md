Things to do

1. Create a form to allow the user to enter 
    1. Name
    2. Gender

    11. Add relevant front-end validation to the form
    12. After form submission, if fields are valid, the input data should be stored in the database of your choice.
    13. The admin user should have ability to display the records in a nice format, update, delete and undelete, bulk-delete, bulk-undelete the record from the admin interface.

### Things to consider

1. As the task is pretty-easy, we will look into the coding design part of things, just making it work is not enough.
2. Naming for methods, variables, file names, folder structures will be checked.
3. Your git commit history will tell a story of how you thought of the solution please be mindful of it. If you use Pull request to come to your solution its even better.
4. Code it so that the next person who continues that work will like it and not hate the code. Think maintainability of code.
5. Tip: First break your task into logical parts then code it. (First solve the problem. Then write code. - John Johnson)
6. Tip: Commented code is bad, relevant comments about code will be necessary.


### Rules/Requirements

1. This task needs to be completed and submitted back within 7 days of receiving it, if not stated otherwise.
2. You must use Laravel(any version) for backend and Vue.js for frontend part for solving this task. The record should be displayed in different Component than the one used for the input form. You are strictly advised to use Vuex to persist the input data (State management). You must use React Vuex Router for routing.
